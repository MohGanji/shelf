                I like collecting things. <br>
                Not just for the sake of having a collection, and not because Iâ€™m sentimental (I am though).
            </p>
            <p>
                I collect things because I see value in it. <br>
                Collect some information over time, and you have a database. <br>
                Organize that database, and you have insights. <br>
                Study those insights and you have knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I don't want to be a hoarder. <br>
                I don't want to collect things and keep them to myself. <br>
                I like sharing. <br>
                I've benefited from other people sharing what they had collected, and I want to follow their footsteps.
            </p>
            <p>
                The links below are what I believe to be the gold nuggets of the internet. 
                Valuable articles, timeless blogs, insightful videos, and interesting people. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They have changed the way I think, and helped me look at the world differently. <br>
                Advices and stories that I want to revisit from time to time. <br>
                Things that I often refer to, directly or indirectly when talking to others. <br>
                They consciously or subconsciously have helped me when I was indecisive, scared, confused, indifferent, or lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will update <a href="./favs.html">this list</a> over time.
