                    Writing "about me" sections always has a strange feeling!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Mohammad Ganji, I've been a student most of my life, until I got my <a href="https://systems.cs.sfu.ca/people.php">Master's degree from SFU</a>. <br>
                    I created <a href="https://neonomad.substack.com/about?utm_source=ganji_blog_about_me">Learn in the Open</a> 
                    to keep the habit of learning new things alive by building in public.
                    It's a documentation of my curiosities.
                    A newsletter where I create series and share my progress and experiments in learning a new skill through doing a project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I follow many blogs and newsletters. <br>
                    So many that it is hard to select what to read.<br>
                    So I built <a href="/blogfrog">a website</a> to choose a blog post for me. <br>
                    It's Kinda like a blog post dispenser.
