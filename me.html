                <p>
                    I'm a second year <a href="https://systems.cs.sfu.ca/people.php">computer science master's student at SFU</a>. <br>
                    I research on making better software (and making existing software better) for modern programming needs. <br>
                    My passion lies somewhere in the intersection of software, human behavior, and education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I follow many blogs.    
                    So many that it is hard to select what to read.<br>
                    So I built <a href="http://blogfrog.xyz">a website</a> to choose a blog post for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people influence my thoughts and actions significantly.<br>
                    I keep a list of them <a href="/heros">here</a>, sorted from my most favorite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to read books. <br>
                    I don't get to reread them because of my large queue of unread books.<br>
                    So I take notes of <a href="/library">what I learn from my favorite books</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a pretty good engineer, and a friendly teammate. <br>
                    You can ask my friends/ex-coworkers. <br>
                    If you are looking to hire me, here's <a href="assets/mohammad-ganji-resume.pdf">my resume</a>.

                    I have a wide range of interests.<br>
                    <!-- Writing, reading non-fiction books, creating memes, storytelling, studying human behavior, and building small useful projects are just a few of them. -->
                    I watch <a href="">body language experts try to find out if people are lying</a> over lunch. <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Lex friedman</a> Podcast, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4rOoJ6Egrf8K2IrywzwOMk">JRE</a>, <a href="https://tim.blog">Tim Ferris</a> Show, <a href="https://ozanvarol.com/famous-failures/">Famous Failures</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/modern-love-podcast">Modern Love</a> from the NYT are my favorite podcasts.
                    They invite amazing guests.
                    This is how I usually find new interesting people. <br>

                    I follow people in business and marketing who try to <a href="https://www.personal-prospecting.com/what-is-it/">make businesses about humans, not customers</a>. <br>
