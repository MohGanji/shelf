                    Here I keep a list of books I loved reading, and will probably read again.
                    It will also contain my notes, basically what I learned from them, how they affected me and how I felt about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for this eLibrary is that I tend to read very slowly.
                    So I need to have a way to choose high quality books.
                    <!-- If I wanted to read a few chapters of every book just to find out they are shitty books, it would've been very time-consuming. -->
                    What helps me most in cherry-picking good books is through the book notes in blogs of people who I follow regularly.
                    Since those people inspire me, their book notes basically lead me to books that shaped their mindsets, so they have a high chance of being good books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm trying to create my own library, to first spread the words of those books, and also share my learning experience from them.
                    I only keep the books that I loved, or learned something new from.
                    If there is a book here, it means I think it is worth reading.
