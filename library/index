                    Here I keep a list of books I loved reading, and will probably read again.
                    It will also contain my notes, basically what I learned from them, how they affected me and how I felt about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tend to read very slowly.
                    <!-- I need to have a way to choose high quality books. -->
                    <!-- If I wanted to read a few chapters of every book just to find out they are shitty books, it would've been very time-consuming. -->
                    What helps me most in cherry-picking good books is through the book notes from my favorite blogs.
                    Since those people inspire me, their book notes basically lead me to books that shaped their mindsets, so there's a good chance I enjoy them.

                    I'm trying to create my own library, to first spread the words of these amazing books, and also share my learning experience from them.
                    I only keep the books that I loved, or learned something new from.
                    If there is a book here, it means I think it is worth reading.
