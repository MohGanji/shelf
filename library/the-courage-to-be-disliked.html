                        I love this books because it combines philosophy with psychology in a story format.
                        It's a dialouge between a wise old man and an inexperienced curious young person.
                        It expands on the Adlerian psychology, on how there is always an internal purpose that justifies our actions(or inactions).
                        It provides controversial and eye-opening views on self-worth, confidence, fear, trauma, superiority, subjectiveness of our worlds, and the meaning of community.

                <p>
                    We live in a subjective world that we give meaning to. 
                    Each of us sees a different world. 
                    It's impossible to share your world with anyone else.
                </p>

                    Excessive self-cauciousness about other peoples opinions, or how they look at you
                    may originate from a deep-seated feeling of inferiority coming from your childhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trauma doesn't exist.
                    Whatever we define as trauma, is a tool we manufacture internally —
                    in order to avoid uncomfortable or unexpected situations we experienced in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. 
                    We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences — the so-called trauma — but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. 
                    We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining."
                    <br>
                    - Alfred Adler

                <p>
                    In human behavior, it's not that something causes something else. 
                    Instead, the true internal purpose of someone determines their actions.
                    <br>
                    For instance, a mother shouting at her child, did not get angry because the child did something wrong.
                    She subconciously used anger as a tool to overpower her child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't rush into growing up.
                    You can't just ask for answers to life from others.
                    Everyone needs their own time to find answers to the questions about life.
                    That's why we experience similar thoughts and concerns with people in our same age range.
