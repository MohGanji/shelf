<p>
    The title is a parody of a quote by Rick Rubin, in his incredible book <a href="https://a.co/d/1tYIviM">The Creative Act: A Way of Being</a>.

    <br>
    I have always been under the impression that there is a right way for anything.
    It led to me to obsess over doing every thing the right way.
    I copied others when they did something that worked for them.
    More often than not, it failed. And I ended up self-criticizing: “It worked for them, I must have done it wrong.”
</p>
<p>
    Our definition of “the right way” is usually a mixture of cultural conventions, religion, and advertised lifestyles of our role models.
    <a href="https://a.co/d/6jKDdxL">Outliers</a> by Malcolm Gladwell explains why mindlessly following our role models' footsteps will most probably not get us to where it got them.
    <!-- TODO: create a post and update link -->
    Culture and religion, on the other hand, are entirely circumstantial.
    They change when you change your location and surroundings.
    I noticed this first when I moved to a bigger city, and then again when I moved to another country. 
    The new environment and culture challenged my most fundamental beliefs, making me question the most basic things in my life.
    <br>
    A strict culture develops a strong inner shame in its people.
    They will be afraid of doing anything unconventional, unique, or original.
    It turns its society into a legacy system and its people into miserable maintainers.
</p>
<p>
    
</p>
<p>
    The inevitable consequence of believing that there is “a right way” is that all other ways are wrong.
    It kills creativity.
    It kills authenticity.
    It creates a fear of trying new things, of acting stupid, of experimenting, and of finding your own way.
