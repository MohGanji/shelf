                    It was an ordinary day and I was working. After a half hour or so, I unconciously opened a new tab, typed in: "twitter.com".
                    Next thing I know is I'm doomscrolling down my twitter feed for an hour.
                    Don't tell me this has never happened to you, this is my every day. 
                </p>

                    The law of Conservation of Habits! says that a habit can not be created or destroyed, it can only be replaced.
                    So I decided to replace my bad habit of scrolling social media with reading random blogs while keeping the same low effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of interesting people on the internet writing cool stuff in their blogs.
                    I learn a lot reading those and getting to know those people.
                    But I never seem to find the time to read these blogs constantly.
                    Deciding which blog to read is also as laborious as choosing a meal from a large menu, I didn't want to deal with that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I built <a href="http://www.blogfrog.xyz">BlogFrog</a>. <br>
                    It's a simple website with one button, that's all.
                    So now every time I get tired of work, or I want to lose focus, I open blogfrog.
                    I let the button take me somewhere random on the internet. I read one blog post, learn something, and I get back to work. 
                    All thanks to the absence of infinite scrolling feed.
                </p>
