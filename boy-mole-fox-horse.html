                    – The mole

                Get the book <a href="https://a.co/d/2gSRFQK">here</a>.
                <p>
                    It's one of those children’s books that I recommend to adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s about appreciation, about curiosity, about adventure, about love. <br>
                    It's about kindness, about beauty, about fears and about fun. <br>
                    It's about everything that truly matters in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's how I used to see life as a child, but gradually forgot as I grew up into an adult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's short, sweet, and lovely. It's like a warm cuddle in a cold, lonely night.
