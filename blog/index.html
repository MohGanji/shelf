                    This is a personal blog, here I will share my personal journey of growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The similarities between us humans are much more than our differences.
                    Reading other people's personal blogs have been super helpful for me.
                    It showed me that I'm not alone.
                    It helped me understand that I too am a human, with similar fears, problems, and concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here I am, externalizing what goes in my mind, sharing my experiences, thoughts, and struggles. 
                    I believe this is what we need more of in this world.
