          <p>
            Two years ago, I created this website with the hopes that it will one day be a digital 
            collection of my intellectual meanderings, enthusiasms, creations, and stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            I called it “the shelf”, to make it a place for my collectibles, 
            valuables, and the little things that remind me of my memories. <br>
            I made this website to look like a bookshelf too. 
            There I would put my notes from my favorite books, people who 
            inspired me, aka my heroes, my projects, stories, and writings.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was (over-)envisioning, some would call it dreaming, the ways to express different aspects of myself. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In my head, I was visualizing a few years down the road where I have hundreds of post written 
            in this blog and built multiple projects. 
            I have some of my ideas realized, and I have an audience who read those and get 
            inspired to do the same. (joke’s on me)
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a few years down the road now and none of those visions are real.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was dreaming big but doing little. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My initial motivation for this blog was to write things that are inherently personal. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t want to be a news channel, or a blog that regurgitates others’ words.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to write and share all those things that make me, me.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing is, I’ve been collecting my thoughts for a while, but sharing them always feels scary and difficult. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel this pressure in my gut when I want to share anything slightly personal, as if I could get hurt by allowing others to read them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t want this website to be up there with nothing in it. 
            So I ended up sharing random momentary nerdy interests that no one cares about,
            <a href="/grahams-number">like other people explaining large numbers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn’t really need to be a blog post. 
            It could simply be a tweet like, 
            “Check out this dude explaining graham’s number for 15 minutes so that he can tell a yo mama joke: LINK”
          </p>
          <p>
            Posts like these are some kind of, umm, justifications so that I can tell myself 
            that I've written some stuff in here, that I’ve done something.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the actual things that I want to say, things that I want to share and are important to me remain unheard. 
          </p>
          <p>
            They live only in my head.
          </p>
          <p>
            But an idea or a thought is worth nothing if it only lives in your head.
          </p>
          <p>
            It feels good to imagine yourself being interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then again, It’s only in your head. Not real.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m not bashing my younger self for the things he didn’t do, I’m just acknowledging that it’s difficult. 
            Creating that entire digital personal shelf that I envisioned takes energy, focus, and above all, courage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve encountered dozens of blogs and personal websites where the header 
            hints you that who built it had high hopes and big dreams in their mind, 
            but when I scroll down, it’s a ghost town.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was hoping writing here would help me get to know me better. 
            Instead, I started faking and deceiving myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't know how long it'll take till I have the courage to share what's really me. 
            But I know that this post is a start.
