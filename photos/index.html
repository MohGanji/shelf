                    I'm often fascinated by how photographers find frames of beauty in what others take for granted.
                    I think its a matter of perspective, of accepting a limitation that all I can't fit the whole world in my frame, so I have to choose.

                    I don't have a camera, and I'm not a professional photographer.
                    I use my phone and try to share the tiniest bit of beauty I observe in my daily life.

                    For now, they are all in this Instagram page: 
                    <a href="https://instagram.com/iphonogr.am">instagram.com/iphonogr.am</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I may one day decide to compile them here in this website since instagram is an external service and it may seize to exist some day.
