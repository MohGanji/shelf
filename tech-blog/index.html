                    This is a tech blog, here I will share things I learn from my work environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A little about me: I have a bachelors of computer science. 
                    During that time, I started working at a startup part-time. 
                    There I had the chance to try a little bit of everything - backend development, front-end development, UX, scrum, mentorship, designing projects from scratch, etc.
                    That startup failed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I started to work at a bigger company, there I was part of a larger community. 
                    I had to communicate with people from sales, design, product managers, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then I quit my job and started studying my master's.
                    Doing research was a completely different story than working in the tech industry.
                    I didn't even know how and what to report to my supervisor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During all these times, I tried to take notes of learning curves and my failures - "<b><i>things</i></b> I wish I knew before I got into this".
                    Here I write about those <b><i>things</i></b>.
