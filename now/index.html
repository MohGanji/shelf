                    This is a now page, inspired by <a href="http://sive.rs">Derek Sivers</a>.
                    It provides the answer to the question "What's up?". 
                    If you have a blog, you should consider creating one too.

                    I'm currently in Vancouver, studying my second year master's in computer science.
                    I'm working on publishing a paper in a high impact conference.

                    I've started taking this blog more seriously. 
                    Now I'm dedicating some time weekly to writing in it.

                    I'm a slow reader, and I get bored reading a single book, 
                    so I usually have two to three books that I'm reading in parallel.
                    I'm currently reading <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1419743031/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_ZRXE1YGWNASKSJ1KN8AA">The Science of Storytelling</a>. An amazing book, combining storytelling with human cognition, evolution, and psychology.
                    I'm also reading <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/0762415339/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_DSBTC8JG8VZHG8Z7G4QK">No more mr. Nice Guy</a> on self-improvement.
                    The third book is my <a href="https://youtu.be/omFti3oZnWk">cousin's book</a>, a story written based on schematherapy principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also working on a small project that I'm planning to use to look for jobs.
                    It helps customizing my resume based on the skill tags I set for each line in the resume.
                    I will publish it when it is useful and easy to use.
