                    This is a now page, inspired by <a href="http://sive.rs">Derek Sivers</a>.
                    Suppose you see someone after a while, they ask you "What's up?". 
                    The now page should be able to answer that for all of your internet friends.
                    If you have a blog, maybe you want to consider letting your friends know what you're up to with a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>.

                    Last month I ran the <a href="https://www.vancouversunrun.com/">Sun Run</a>, a yearly 10k running event in Vancouver.
                    It was my first time doing a 10k, and I loved the journey of practicing for it and the event itself.
                    Running had a significant positive influence on my mood, so I'm trying to make it a habit.

                    I read 11 books last year, most of them were non-fictions.
                    This year I decided to read fewer new books. 
                    Instead I want to re-read some old books and take action on them, rather than using book count as a vanity metric. <br>
                    Currently I'm re-reading <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> to help me
                      establish some habits prioritizng healthy eating and excersizing.
                    I'm also reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity/dp/1250235375/">Radical Candor</a>, 
                     loved the first chapter so far.
