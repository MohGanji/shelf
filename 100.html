            It stuck with me when I heard it from
            <a href="https://lexfridman.com/mrbeast/">MrBeast on Lex Fridman’s podcast</a>.
            <br />
            It’s a simple principle, yet offers a lot of wisdom.
</p>
<p>
            It tells you that you will probably be bad at it the first 99 times, so don’t be hard on
            yourself.
</p>
<p>
            That you will not see any results at first, so be patient.
</p>
<p>
            It tells you to shut down your analytical mind and just do the damn thing.
</p>
<p>
            To prioritize doing, that you will learn most when you actually do
            something.
            <!-- TODO: Another post about If you want to learn X, do X. Everything else is distraction https://t.me/c/1427051388/209 -->
</p>
<p>
            To focus on quantity at the beginning and not on quality.
</p>
<p>
            It is actionable, now you know exactly what to do when you want to start something.
</p>
<p>
            It could be anything you like; painting, blogging, making videos, or learning a new
            sport.
            <br />
            Whatever it is you want to start, do it 100 times first, then we’ll talk.
