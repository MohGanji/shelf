            <p>I had a shoulder injury a few years ago.</p>

            <p>After that, I struggled to go back to working out consistently.</p>

            <p>I signed up for an expensive gym.</p>

            <p>They had an incentive where I had to pay a penalty if I wanted to cancel my membership in less than a year. </p>

            <p>I bought into it thinking that it would push me into going to the gym even if I don’t want to, because I’m paying for it and it costs a lot to cancel.</p>

            <p>Three months passed and I only went to that gym four times.</p>

            <p>I realized financial pressure as a source of motivation was not working for me.</p>

            <p>As painful as it was, I paid the penalty and canceled my membership.</p>

            <p>A few weeks later, I was telling this story to my colleague, he told me he goes to a group workout gym, he has been going there for two years.</p>

            <p>He mentioned that they offer a free trial session and I should go with him once.</p>

            <p>I always had an awkward feeling towards group workout gyms, I didn’t see a point in them.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t that inclined to going, but wasn’t opposed to it either. I responded with a hesitant “sure”.</p>

            <p>I thought to myself: I just won't bring it up and he'll forget.</p>

            <p>The very next day he messaged me: “I’m hitting the gym at 5:45, wanna do your free session? I called them and asked, they still have free spots.”</p>

            <p>He already had gone above and beyond for getting me into the gym, so I gave it a shot.</p>

            <p>The class was intense, and I haven’t been working out for a while.</p>

            <p>Ten minutes into the class, I was completely out of breath. I barely tried to keep up.</p>

            <p>Everyone else made it look easy, meanwhile I was gasping, my legs were heavy, and my lungs were burning.</p>

            <p>I would never push myself this much when I went to the gym by myself.</p>

            <p>I would rest more if I felt tired.</p>

            <p>I would go home sooner if I didn’t feel like working out.</p>

            <p>I would lift lighter weights if I wasn’t in a good mood.</p>

            <p>But none of these matters when the class had a fixed one hour schedule and a coach was constantly watching over me.</p>

            <p>Besides, others were running or lifting by my side, doing the same workouts and making me feel like I was the lazy one.</p>

            <p>After the class I was physically dead, but mentally, I felt alive.</p>

            <p>I signed up.</p>

            <p>First few weeks were basically my colleague poking me with a "gym 5:45?" text message and me finding enough motivation to book the class.</p>

            <p>It became a habit for me after that, an essential part of my life, and I kept going consistently.</p>

            <p>I still need the occasional "gym 5:45?" nudges from time to time though.</p>

            <p>But I figured it's not just me who loses motivation.</p>

            <p>Some days a seemingly insignificant “gym 5:45?” text from me would bring him to the gym, even though he was not feeling like doing it.</p>

            <p>***</p>

            <p>I was talking about signing up for a 10k running event with a few people I just met, and one of them mentioned that he used to run marathons. </p>

            <p>It peaked my interest because I always liked running but had never ran anything more than 5 kilometers before.</p>

            <p>We chatted a bit more and I threw the idea of going for a 5k run next weekend to practice.</p>

            <p>He was down for it. </p>

            <p>I had no way back.</p>

            <p>Saturday morning, I saw myself waiting for him in running shoes, contemplating about why the hell I’m here.</p>

            <p>We ran a 5k that day, and it felt lively.</p>

            <p>We did another 5k next week, a 10k the week after, and a 10k almost every weekend  for quite a few months.</p>

            <p>I’m writing this on a weekend, at the time where I would usually be running a 10k with that same friend. But he is sick today, and I’m on my own. </p>

            <p>I decided to go for a run by myself. </p>

            <p>As you could guess, I still haven’t.</p>

            <p>I’ve been procrastinating this run for 4 hours now, with every productive and unproductive activity possible. </p>

            <p>I played video games, cooked, watched TV, and now I’m writing these stories.</p>

            <p>You know what made the difference? The conversation the night before that said: “Let’s go for a run Sat 10am”  followed by “Hell yea, see you then.”</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t be running every week if it wasn’t for my friend, and he wouldn’t be running every week if it wasn’t for me.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Now I'm not saying you should go and find a group workout gym and sign up for it.</p>

            <p>I'm also not saying you should go and run every week.</p>

            <p>What I am saying is that if you want to do something hard, find a buddy.</p>

            <p>You will be amazed to see your combined willpower outperform your individual willpowers combined.</p>

            <p>I hope the math in the title is mathing for you now. </p>

            <p>Ok, gotta run now.</p>
