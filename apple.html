    "Life is like an apple." said my friend.
</p>
<p>
    "Why?" I asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't it obvious? Life is like an apple," he responded.
</p>
<p>
    "Is it because it can have different colors? Or maybe you mean life is simple, just like.. an apple?" I asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Maybe, maybe not," he responded. 
</p>
<p>
    "But if you are being that vague, I can make that analogy with everything, like, why isn't life like an orange?"
</p>
<p>
    "Does life really look like an orange you to? Life is obviously like an apple."
</p>
<p>
    It's been years since that conversation with my friend. He kept repeating this a couple times again and the apple never got any less mysterious.

    I've been searching for a meaningful title for this personal blog for a long time, all to no avail.
</p>
<p>
    But...
</p>

<p>
    Why does everything need be meaningful? <br>
    What's the urge to search for a meaning in everything? <br>
    Who said meaningless can't be fun? <br>
</p>
<p>
    I never really understood what my friend meant by that "Life is like an apple" thing. 
    Maybe he made it up. 
    Maybe he heard it from someone else and it kept haunting him.
</p>
<p>
    But you know what else I never really understood? Life.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe life <b>is</b> like an apple after all.
